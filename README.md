Plot.ly Challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity 
Where does the data come from? 

The data is provided by GA Tech University Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

What did I do? 
In this assignment, I've built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.  

  Use the D3 library to read in samples.json.  
  Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in selected test ID.  
  Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.  Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.  
  Create the Gauge Chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.  
  Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.  
  Deploy the app to GitHub Pages.
